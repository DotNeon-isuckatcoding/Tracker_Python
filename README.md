# Tracker_Python
Python Tracker (or EZ_tracker) lets you grab data from a public ip address. using python!

you can run straight from the file now.

use these commands to install the imports.

# Windows
```
pip install time && pip install socket && pip install requests
```

# Linux/Mac (maybe) 
```
yay -S python-time && yay -S python-socket && yay -S python-requests
```
for mac you might have to use your own package although the commands would be the same (ex) python-xyz

# ubuntu/debain based linux distros.

```
sudo apt install python-time && sudo apt install python-socket && sudo apt install python-requests
```

For other systems it would be (ex) *your package manager install* python-xyz
